	same video dataset file with several video player tools. 
* New FFMPEG version : FFMPEG website (http://ffmpegg.sourceforge.net/) 
	officially claim version 0.4.6 obsolete. Indeed many bugs in API caused 
	some problems to us. New version (ffmpeg-cvs-20030820).
* Video encoder modification : for making easier to read the encoded videos, 
	MJPEG has been chosen (JPEG frames, in the original order). Modifications of class SwMpegEncoder and calls from WorkshopVideoCapture with MJPEG codec.
* Enables user-only installation : don't need to be root !
