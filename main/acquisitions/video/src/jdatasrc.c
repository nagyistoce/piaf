 * Fill the input buffer --- called whenever buffer is emptied.
 *
 * In typical applications, this should read fresh data into the buffer
 * (ignoring the current state of next_input_byte & bytes_in_buffer),
 * reset the pointer & count to the start of the buffer, and return TRUE
 * indicating that the buffer has been reloaded.  It is not necessary to
 * fill the buffer entirely, only to obtain at least one more byte.
 *
 * There is no such thing as an EOF return.  If the end of the file has been
 * reached, the routine has a choice of ERREXIT() or inserting fake data into
 * the buffer.  In most cases, generating a warning message and inserting a
 * fake EOI marker is the best course of action --- this will allow the
 * decompressor to output however much of the image is there.  However,
 * the resulting error message is misleading if the real problem is an empty
 * input file, so we handle that case specially.
 *
 * In applications that need to be able to suspend compression due to input
 * not being available yet, a FALSE return indicates that no more data can be
 * obtained right now, but more may be forthcoming later.  In this situation,
 * the decompressor will return to its caller (with an indication of the
 * number of scanlines it has read, if any).  The application should resume
 * decompression after it has loaded more data into the input buffer.  Note
 * that there are substantial restrictions on the use of suspension --- see
 * the documentation.
 *
 * When suspending, the decompressor will back up to a convenient restart point
 * (typically the start of the current MCU). next_input_byte & bytes_in_buffer
 * indicate where the restart point will be if the current call returns FALSE.
 * Data beyond this point must be rescanned after resumption, so move it to
 * the front of the buffer rather than discarding it.
