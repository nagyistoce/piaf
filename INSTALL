# INSTALLATION

You need to build binaries first (GUI, libs and plugins), then to install it on you system.
- First, as user, build Piaf lib, GUI and all vision plugins:
user$ ./build.sh

	If build fails, you need to install the required packages for building piaf.
	A script if provided for Debian/Ubuntu packages, run as root:
root# ./prepare_debian.sh

- Then, as root : create local directories and install all built
root# ./install.sh

# LATER COMPILATION :
- if you patched Piaf SwPluginCore lib or GUI:
	- for testing: run build.sh as user to update GUI binary and libs
	- for installing or build+install: just run the ./install.sh

- if you modified only the plugins' source code: as user, run the build script to build plugins :
user$ ./build.sh

OR: go directly to the plugin directory, e.g. plugins/vision/ and run ./build_all.sh
user$ ./build_all.sh
You don't need installation or restarting the GUI, the binaries are already updated so Piaf GUI can load then at any time.
