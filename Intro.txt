				PIAF / Image processing prototyping

							Introduction

****************************************************************************

Goals
=====
Piaf's goal is to provide a tool for developping computer vision algorithms, easily
and without having to care about acquisition of pictures, movies or live video devices...

Piaf provides the graphical reading and displays of "image sources" (still
pictures, movies or live input from devices), AND a tools for adding your own plugins.

Each "image" source can be displayed, processed by plugins ...
Thus you can develop your own image processing algorithm, Piaf does the remaining functions.
No need to be a senior developper to add your own plugins.

Just do the image processing, Piaf does the rest.

Features:
=========

GUI : released under GPL :
- support: still images, standard movie files, live video inputs (V4L/V4L2, ieee1394, GigEVision)
- player/display : zoom, palettes, ...
- plugins manager which :
	add/remove plugins
	sequence plugins operations,
	generate parameters windows for every function
	measure processing time

Plugins :
The plugin principles have been decided to be *very* simple for researchers, not for expert developpers

- each plugin is a separated processus/application, communicating with Piaf through pipes ;
- each plugin can export several functions, one plugin executes only one function
- plugins can :
	- declare parameters, exported into Piaf's GUI
	- crash without restarting piaf
	- use any library or ressources : files, ... (excluding stdout/stdin)
	- be debugged with gdb, profiled by valgrind, ...
- processed by plugins : input -> plugin 1 -> plugin 2 ...
- interface library is released under LGPL : you can keep your intellectual property on your algorithms

Examples of plugins are provided for simple operations : OpenCV basic tools (morphology, histograms, ...), FFTW (blur), ...

Project state:
==============
Status: beta (for a long time)

Dependencies:
- GUI/acquisition : Qt4, OpenCV, FFMPEG
- Plugins : none
